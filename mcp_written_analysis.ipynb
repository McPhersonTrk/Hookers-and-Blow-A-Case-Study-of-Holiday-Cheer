    "The supply and demand of joy appear to exhibit nuanced patterns during both challenging and prosperous times, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the economic downturn of 2008, characterized by the great recession, the incident rates for drug and prostitution-related categories were relatively high in both New York City (NYC) and San Francisco (SF). Despite the overall economic hardship, there seemed to be a notable prevalence of incidents related to drugs and prostitution, which might be indicative of individuals seeking coping mechanisms or alternative sources of income during tough times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastingly, during the recovery phase in 2017, joy, as inferred from the context of incidents, appears to be more abundant. The incident rates for both drug and prostitution-related categories in NYC and SF significantly decreased, suggesting a potential positive correlation between economic recovery and a reduction in such incidents. It is important to note that this analysis is based on incidents per 10,000 population and does not directly measure the emotional well-being of individuals, but it provides an indirect perspective on societal activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while joy, as indicated by the decline in certain incidents, appears more abundant during economic recovery in 2017, the complex nature of joy makes it challenging to pinpoint a singular moment when it is most abundant. Joy can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, societal dynamics, and individual circumstances."
