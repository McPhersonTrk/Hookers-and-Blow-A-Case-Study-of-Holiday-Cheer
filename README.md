  # Data cleaning

    1. We used two datasets of historical criminal activity for NYC and San Francisco.

         a) Narrowing down our data to the selected timeframes for comparison: December 2008 and 2017 for both cities.

         b) We extracted data for two major criminal activities, narcotics and prostitution, and then created four sub-dataframes to analyze.

    2. The next step is to manipulate, aggregate, and graph the data to see what findings we come up with and find if there are any clear answers to our inquiries.
