  # Objective:

  # Comparison of holiday cheer, via cocaine and prostitution, over the holiday seasons of 2008 and 2017.

  # Questions: 

    1-- What day of the week has the highest rates of feel-good family fun?

    2-- Which part of the city has the highest probability of finding a good time?

    3-- What is the best time to find cheerful activities?

    4-- Good times or bad, cheer is readily available, but when is it more available?

    5-- How much does it cost to be in the spirit of the season?

    6-- New or used market; which age category is the most cheerful?

    7-- East coast vs West coast; which gangstas have the most fun?

  # Data cleaning

    1. We used two datasets of historical criminal activity for NYC and San Francisco.

         a) Narrowing down our data to the selected timeframes for comparison: December 2008 and 2017 for both cities.

         b) We extracted data for two major criminal activities, narcotics and prostitution, and then created four sub-dataframes to analyze.

    2. The next step is to manipulate, aggregate, and graph the data to see what findings we come up with and find if there are any clear answers to our inquiries.
